# Rational-Numbers-Assembly
This homework assignment entailed writing a program in MIPS that accepts two rational numbers and performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on these rational numbers. The program also displays the result in fraction form, and handles the case where you divide by zero.
